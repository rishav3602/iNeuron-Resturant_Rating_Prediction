# Resturant_Rating_Prediction

## Resturant Rating Prediction

## Problem Statement:

The main goal of this project is to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on
the Zomato Dataset and build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help
various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain
features.

## Goal:

We have to build a solution that should able to predict the ratings of the restaurants listed in the dataset.

## Approach: 

The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.
